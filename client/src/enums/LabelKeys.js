/*
 * Conventions:
 *  - The keys are constant, so write them uppercase.
 *  - Use underline characters to separate words/segments.
 *  - Start with a section name (e.g. AUTH) and keep sections together.
 *  - If possible define the element it is bind to like a button (BTN).
 *  - Longer messages to the user, which describe something are shorten to MSG and then the topic.
 *  - Always try to get a classification which can be reused for similar labels.
 *  - Use conventional abbreviations, cause you have to write them everywhere this label is used.
